This repository contains the Python code used for the experiments from our LAK 2021 paper: [Linguistic Skill Modeling for Second Language Acquisition](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448139.3448153). Authors: Brian Zylich and Andrew Lan.

Some of the code in this repository is based on code from [Beno√Æt Choffin](https://github.com/BenoitChoffin)'s [DAS3H repository](https://github.com/BenoitChoffin/das3h).

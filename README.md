# Linguistic Skill Modeling for Second Language Acquisition

This repository contains the Python code used for the experiments from our LAK 2021 paper: [Linguistic Skill Modeling for Second Language Acquisition](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448139.3448153). Authors: Brian Zylich (bzylich@umass.edu) and Andrew Lan.

The data we use can be [downloaded](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/N8XJME) from Duolingo. We also use their [HLR code](https://github.com/duolingo/halflife-regression) as a baseline for our experiments.

Some of the code in this repository is based on code from [Beno√Æt Choffin](https://github.com/BenoitChoffin)'s [DAS3H repository](https://github.com/BenoitChoffin/das3h).
